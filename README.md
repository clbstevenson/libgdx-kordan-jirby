# libgdx-rain

### Goals of this project

* Testing and learning about libgdx resources and functions
  * Includes: collision detection, processing efficiency, and entity and input handling
* Improving an [old project](#original-project)
* Developing an application to be released, primarily through GooglePlay

The basis for this repository is my high school senior project. The original was the largest project I had worked on, but it was also several years ago. With this new version, I hope to improve and make some fundamental changes to the gameplay. Graphics and performance should be improved from the original.

### Branch Project: local-jkirby

The local-jkirby branch is a related project to libgdx-rain, using the same library. However it is a test case for the larger project. It highlights some of the basic features needed, such as the following: Sprite rendering, animations, collision detection, graphics scaling and screen size adjustments, texture packing, and finally app submission to Google Play.

In fact, this respository may become a hub for my libgdx projects. The repository could be renamed libgdx-exovum or something along those lines. This will be resolved later. TODO.

Further, as one of the desired features to be tested is Google Play app submission, the link to the local-jkirby app will be linked HERE.

I recently found my old project and uploaded the code to github. In fact, you can [download the last release here](https://github.com/exovum/PenguinPong/releases/download/v1.3/PenguinPong_1-3-1.jar) from github.
