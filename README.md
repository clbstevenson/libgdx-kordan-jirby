# libgdx-kordan-jirby

This project is a present I made for a friend for his birthday. It is a simple 2D runner made using libGDX where the player jumps over obstacles to go as far as possible. 

The **Kordan Jirby** project has been [released to the Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exovum.test.collisions.android) app store.

### Store Listing
In this 2D runner you play as Kordan Jirby, the hero the world nee-well, the one it has left. He was brought into service not because his skills were top notch or he was the most brave. Instead, Kordan was a last resort. Try your best using your limited jumping abilities and lack of coordination to reach the end of the map, if there even is one.
Kordan Jirby has been given a hypsometer, a tool for measuring the height of trees or tall objects. With it, he can leap to great heights simply with the tap or swipe of the screen! Surely this is all the help a normal athlete needs to reach his goal.

Controls:
- Tap the screen for a quick jump over short obstacles
- Swipe the screen up/down for a high jump over tall obstacles
