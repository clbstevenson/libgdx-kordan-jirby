# libgdx-rain

### Goals of this project

* Testing and learning about libgdx resources and functions
  * Includes: collision detection, processing efficiency, and entity and input handling
* Improving an [old project](#original-project)
* Developing an application to be released, primarily through GooglePlay

The basis for this repository is my high school senior project. The original was the largest project I had worked on, but it was also several years ago. With this new version, I hope to improve and make some fundamental changes to the gameplay. Graphics and performance should be improved from the original.

I recently found my old project and uploaded the code to github. In fact, you can [download the last release here](https://github.com/exovum/PenguinPong/releases/download/v1.3/PenguinPong_1-3-1.jar) from github.
